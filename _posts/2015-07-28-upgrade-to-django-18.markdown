First of all: **the project is not dead!**

## New Django codebase

After more than one year of silence, an important update landed on the **develop** branch on [GitHub]: **django ERP** is now based on [**Django 1.8.x**] [Django] (currently **1.8.3**).

According to the Django roadmap, the **1.8** is the new **LTS (Long-Term Support)** release. This has an important implication for **django ERP**: this version of Django will receive security updates for at least three years after its initial release.

If you want to learn more about all the new features provided by the latest Django release, please read the official [release notes] [Django release notes].

## What's next?

The plan for **django ERP** is simply to follow the [official roadmap], with one important addition: is now clear the **front-end** also needs a more solid foundation. In order to achieve this goal, in the near future we plan to refactor the entire *front-end* on the top of [Bootstrap] and [Font Awesome icons] technologies.

In order to be informed about the current state of the project and future plans, please visit the [official roadmap].

To know more about **django ERP** releases, please read the [official release policy].
