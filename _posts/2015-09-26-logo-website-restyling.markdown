We are happy to present a full restyling of **django ERP** website.

## New font-end framework

The new layout is based on the solid [Semantic UI] front-end framework.

We chose to implement tha website layout on the top of **Semantic UI** because, as its official website claims, it is designed completely with em making responsive sizing a breeze. Design variations built into elements allow you to make the choice how content adjusts for tablet and mobile.

As you can see, the layout is now more *elegant* and *stylish*, with more space for information and displayed in a clearer way.

## Flat logo

We also chose to give to **django ERP** logo a more flat style followed by a new lettering.

In the following picture you can see the difference between the old version and the revamped logo:

**We hope you appreciate this new style!**
